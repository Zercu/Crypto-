## How It Works

1. **Crypto Predictions**:
   - The bot uses technical indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands to generate predictions. Users can react to predictions with "ðŸ”¼ Up Tick" or "ðŸ”» Down Tick".

2. **Marketplace**:
   - Users can list items with details and a UPI ID. When a buyer makes a purchase, they provide the UPI transaction ID for verification. The seller confirms the sale, and the bot processes the payment (with a 25% commission).

3. **Subscriptions**:
   - Users can subscribe to the prediction service through Razorpay. The bot automatically handles the subscription duration and sends predictions at the selected interval.

4. **Admin Panel**:
   - Admins can manage subscription prices, send announcements, and view subscriptions. These features ensure that the service remains flexible and responsive to user needs.
